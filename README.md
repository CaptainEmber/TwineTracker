**Health Tracker**
Each enemy in your encounter has to have a different ID for the elements. E.G. guard1, guard2, etc.

**Attack Macros**
A simple click-rerun macro will suffice here, and for ease of use I made the attack and damage rolls at the same time.

**Read Aloud**
A nice little box with a tan background. Perfect of letting DM's ST's and showrunners what to divulge and what to keep secret.

**Random Encounters**
These are a little tricky, but basically involve some custom links, that set a variable to the name of the destination the player wants to go to, and then they take them to a random encounter page. On the random encounter page, there are all the encounters you care to program, and a link to take them to the location listed on the variable.
